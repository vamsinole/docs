## First-Time Setup (API Key)
The app stores your ContactSwing API key in a Zoho org variable `contactswing_api_key`.

### Option A — set from the app
1. Open the “ContactSwing” tab in Zoho CRM.
2. If prompted, paste your ContactSwing API key and save.
3. The key is saved to `contactswing_api_key` for your org.

### Option B — set manually in Zoho
1. Setup → Developer Space → Variables.
2. Add variable with name: `contactswing_api_key` (case sensitive).
3. Value: your ContactSwing API key.
4. Save and reload the app tab.

**Verification**: The app should load without “missing API key” errors, and your user should be detected.

## Permissions and Scopes Used
- **Read access**: Leads, Current User, basic org config
- **Embedded events**: `PageLoad`, `List_SelectionChanged`
- **Data writes**: None unless you launch a campaign (then activity metadata may be synced back via ContactSwing backend if configured)

## Selecting Leads (Required)
- From Leads → List View: check one or more records. Then open the “ContactSwing” tab. The app detects selection automatically.
- From Lead detail: open the Lead, then open the “ContactSwing” tab. The app detects the current Lead.

Notes: Current version targets the Leads module. Contacts/Accounts support may be added in future versions.

## Creating a Campaign
1. Open “ContactSwing” tab (ensure leads are selected or a lead is open).
2. Choose Communication Type:
   - Voice Call
   - SMS
   - Email
   - WhatsApp
3. Select AI Agent:
   - Pick an agent compatible with the chosen channel.
   - Optional: add agent instructions/context.
4. Choose Campaign and Touchpoint:
   - Select an existing ContactSwing campaign.
   - Pick the touchpoint (e.g., “Initial Outreach”, “Follow‑up 1”).
5. Channel-specific content:

   - **Email**: subject + HTML/text content; choose “From” address/provider
   - **Voice**: caller number/brand + guidance to the AI agent
   - **WhatsApp**: approved template + variables

   - Timezone
   - Start hour and end hour windows
   - Execution window rules
7. Review and Launch:

   - Launch

The app calls ContactSwing’s backend to create and run the campaign. Status is shown in-app; optional CRM sync writes outcomes back (if enabled in your ContactSwing account).

## Technical Integration

### Authentication
- Runs as a Zoho embedded app; user authentication/session is handled by Zoho OAuth 2.0.
- No separate OAuth configuration is required inside the extension for Zoho access.
- ContactSwing API access uses an org variable `contactswing_api_key` stored in Zoho (set once per org).

### Data Synchronization
- Real-time retrieval of selected Lead data from CRM
- Optional sync of campaign results back to CRM (notes/activities/custom fields)
- Embedded app event handling for record selection
- Continuous updates via ContactSwing backend when campaigns execute

### API Integration
- Uses Zoho CRM APIs to:
  - Fetch current user context
  - Retrieve selected Lead records
  - Listen/respond to embedded events (`PageLoad`, `List_SelectionChanged`)
- Uses ContactSwing APIs to:
  - Create campaigns and schedule executions
  - Manage agents, templates, and providers (configured in ContactSwing)
  - Optionally push execution outcomes to CRM

## Data Flow
- **Read from Zoho CRM**: current user, selected Leads’ core fields (Name, Email, Phone, Company)
- **Sent to ContactSwing**: normalized lead identifiers + selected campaign configuration
- **Optional sync-back**: campaign run metadata can be pushed back to CRM (notes/activities/custom fields) if configured in ContactSwing

## Troubleshooting
- **App keeps loading/hangs**:
  - Reload the “ContactSwing” tab.
  - Ensure you’re on a Zoho CRM domain (e.g., crm.zoho.com or your sandbox domain).
  - Wait up to 30 seconds on first init (Zoho embedded app init).
  - Disable ad blockers for the Zoho domain.
- **No leads detected**:
  - In Leads → List View, select records with checkboxes first, then open the “ContactSwing” tab.
  - From a specific lead’s detail page, open the tab; the app should detect the current record.
- **Missing/invalid API key**:
  - Set `contactswing_api_key` via the in‑app prompt or Setup → Developer Space → Variables.
  - Paste a valid key from your ContactSwing account.
- **Permission errors**:
  - Reinstall/repair the extension in Setup → Marketplace → Installed Extensions → ContactSwing → Configure.
  - Ensure users have access to the extension and Leads module.
- **Sandbox vs Production**:
  - Verify you installed the extension and configured the API key in the same environment (sandbox keys won’t work in production and vice versa).

## Admin Operations
- **Configure/Repair**: Setup → Marketplace → Installed Extensions → ContactSwing → Configure
- **Update**: Accept updates in Marketplace when prompted
- **Uninstall**: Setup → Marketplace → Installed Extensions → ContactSwing → Uninstall

## Security
- **API key storage**: Zoho org variable `contactswing_api_key`.

- **Scopes**: Only required scopes are requested; no external data is pulled without your action.
