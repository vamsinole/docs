## What is SMTP?

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is the standard protocol used to send emails over the internet. With the **SMTP integration in ContactsWing**, you configure your own email server settings to send emails directly from your domain—ensuring full control, branding, and deliverability. ✉️

By connecting your own SMTP account, you enable ContactsWing to send emails **on your behalf**, using the sender details you provide. 🚀

# Step-by-step guide

Follow these steps to add the SMTP integration:

### Step 1: Go to the Integrations section
Go to the **Integrations** section in your application. Here, you find a list of external services available for integration. Select **SMTP** to start the setup process.
