## ðŸ”§ How Twilio is used in our platform

Once integrated, Twilio allows you to:

- **Purchase phone numbers**: Buy virtual phone numbers directly from the Twilio interface integrated into our platform.
- **Send SMS messages**: Use these phone numbers for your AI Agents to send and receive SMS as part of automated workflows, notifications, or bot conversations.
- **Make voice calls**: Enable your agents to handle inbound and outbound calls using Twilio's programmable voice services.

### ðŸ§¾ Don't have a Twilio account?

No worries â€” if you don't have a Twilio account:
- We automatically **create a sub-account** for you under our Twilio master account **after you purchase a mobile number**.
- You can start using it immediately for calls and SMS, without needing to set up anything manually.

> ðŸ’¡ Your Twilio usage and communication costs are managed through your billing dashboard in our platform.
