## What is SIP?
**Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)** is a protocol for making voice and video calls over the internet. SIP lets you use VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) for calls, offering a modern alternative to traditional phone lines.

## Why use SIP for outbound calls?
SIP-based outbound calling offers several advantages:
- **Lower costs**: Reduce expenses for phone lines and long-distance calls.
- **Global reach**: Call from anywhere with an internet connection.
- **Scalability**: Expand or reduce call capacity as needed.
- **High call quality**: Enjoy clearer audio with a stable connection.
- **Business integration**: Connect SIP with CRM, call centers, and automation tools.
