# ‚òéÔ∏è Inbound SIP call

Enable inbound SIP calls to your assistants for flexible, cost-effective communication. This guide explains what SIP is, why it's beneficial, and how to set up inbound SIP calls. üåêüìû

## What is SIP?
**Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)** is a protocol for starting, managing, and ending real-time voice and video calls over the internet. SIP uses VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), so you can make calls online instead of using traditional phone lines.

## Why use SIP?
SIP offers several advantages over traditional calling:
- **Cost-effective**: Make calls over the internet and reduce long-distance charges.
- **Scalable**: Add or remove phone numbers without extra hardware.
- **Flexible**: Make and receive calls from computers, mobile devices, or VoIP phones.
- **High call quality**: Enjoy better audio with a stable internet connection.
- **Business integration**: Connect SIP with CRM, call centers, and other tools for efficiency.

## Call routing
Configure your phone number to an assistant. For example, if assistant ID 443 is linked to `+12359845123`, initiate the SIP call to:
```
+12359845123@bluespace.sip.twilio.com
```

Our system automatically identifies the number and routes the call to **Assistant 443** for handling. ü§ñ

## Important note
