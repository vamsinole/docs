## What is SIP trunking?

**Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking** lets you make and receive phone calls and other digital communications over the internet. A **trunk** is a virtual phone line that allows calls over the internet to anyone with a phone number.

SIP trunks support voice, video, and messaging, replacing analog and ISDN phone lines. Many countries are phasing out ISDN, making SIP trunking the future of business telephony.
