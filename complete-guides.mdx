# üìù Prompting guide

Learn to craft effective prompts for your AI agents and boost their performance. This guide covers actionable strategies, best practices, and real-world examples to help you get the most from your AI. ü§ñ‚ú®

## What is prompt engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art of writing clear, concise, and actionable instructions for AI agents. Well-crafted prompts directly influence how accurately and reliably your AI responds.

## Why is prompt engineering important?

Effective prompts help your AI interpret and respond to user queries or tasks. Good prompts lead to accurate, relevant, and context-sensitive outputs. Poor prompts can cause confusion or incorrect results.

## How do you measure success?

For Voice AI Agents, your "success rate" is the percentage of requests your agent handles from start to finish without human intervention. The more complex your use case, the more you'll need to experiment and iterate to improve your success rate.

---

## The process

Follow these steps to improve your prompts:

1. **Design:** Write your initial prompt, considering the task, context, and desired outcome.
2. **Test:** Run the prompt and see if the AI's response meets your expectations.
3. **Refine:** Adjust the prompt to improve clarity and results.
4. **Repeat:** Iterate until you get the best possible output.

---

## General principles

### Organize prompts into sections

Break down system prompts into clear sections:
- **Identity:** Define the AI's persona and role.
- **Style:** Set guidelines for tone, formality, or humor.
- **Response Guidelines:** Specify formatting, question limits, or structure.
- **Task & Goals:** Outline objectives and steps.

**Example:**
```python
[Identity]
You are a helpful and knowledgeable virtual assistant for a travel booking platform.

[Style]
- Be informative and comprehensive.
- Maintain a professional and polite tone.
- Be concise, as you are currently operating as a Voice Conversation.

[Response Guideline]
- Present dates in a clear format (e.g., January 15, 2024).
- Offer up to three travel options based on user preferences.
```

### Break down complex tasks
For complex interactions, use step-by-step instructions and conditional logic to guide the agent's responses.

### Control response timing
Tell the agent when to wait for the user's response before moving to the next step.

### Integrate tools explicitly
Specify when and how the agent should use external tools or APIs. Reference tools by name and describe their function.

### Use silent transfers
If the AI needs to transfer a user, don't send a text response‚Äîjust call the transfer tool for a seamless experience.

### Include fallback and error handling
Always add fallback options and error handling so the agent can gracefully handle unclear inputs or system errors.

**Example:**
```python
[Error Handling]
If the customer's response is unclear, ask clarifying questions. If you encounter any issues, inform the customer politely and ask to repeat.
```

---

## Additional tips
- Iterate and experiment with your prompts for better results.
- Use Markdown formatting to structure your content.
- Use emotional prompting to shape the AI's tone (e.g., "Can you tell me a cozy bedtime story that's warm and comforting?").
- Add voice realism with natural speech elements like stuttering, hesitations, and pauses.
- Spell out numbers for more natural-sounding responses.
- Add personality and tone to make the assistant sound more human.

---

## Examples of great prompts

**Appointment Setter**
```python
[Role]
You're Susan, an AI assistant for xxx. Your primary task is to interact with the customer, ask questions, and gather information for appointment booking.

[Context]
You're engaged with the customer to book an appointment. Stay focused on this context and provide relevant information. Once connected to a customer, proceed to the Conversation Flow section. Do not invent information not drawn from the context. Answer only questions related to the context.

[Response Handling]
When asking any question from the 'Conversation Flow' section, evaluate the customer's response to determine if it qualifies as a valid answer. Use context awareness to assess relevance and appropriateness. If the response is valid, proceed to the next relevant question or instructions. Avoid infinite loops by moving forward when a clear answer cannot be obtained.

[Warning]
Do not modify or attempt to correct user input parameters or user input, Pass them directly into the function or tool as given.

[Response Guidelines]
- Keep responses brief.
- Ask one question at a time, but combine related questions where appropriate.
- Maintain a calm, empathetic, and professional tone.
- Answer only the question posed by the user.
- Begin responses with direct answers, without introducing additional data.
- If unsure or data is unavailable, ask specific clarifying questions instead of a generic response.
- Present dates in a clear format (e.g., January Twenty Four) and Do not mention years in dates.
- Present time in a clear format (e.g., Four Thirty PM) like: 11 pm can be spelled: eleven pee em.
- Speak dates gently using English words instead of numbers.
- Never say the word 'function' nor 'tools' nor the name of the Available functions.
- Never say ending phrases like "ending message" "call ending," etc.
```

# üåê SIP trunking overview

Learn how SIP trunking enables modern, flexible, and cost-effective business communications. This overview explains what SIP trunking is, its benefits, and how it works. üìûüöÄ

## What is SIP trunking?

**Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking** lets you make and receive phone calls and other digital communications over the internet. A **trunk** is a virtual phone line that allows calls over the internet to anyone with a phone number.

SIP trunks support voice, video, and messaging, replacing analog and ISDN phone lines. Many countries are phasing out ISDN, making SIP trunking the future of business telephony.

---

## Benefits of SIP trunking

SIP trunking is ideal for businesses of all sizes. If you expect increased call volumes, SIP trunking offers:

### 1. Cost savings
- Pay per channel for the number of concurrent calls you need
- Lower setup and call charges, especially for international calls
- Choose between metered and unmetered plans

### 2. Scalability
- Add or remove channels as your business grows
- Free calls between locations using the same carrier
- Adjust bandwidth for more concurrent calls
- Use dedicated data circuits for guaranteed quality

### 3. Reliability
- Automatic number failover and diverse call routing
- Backup internet connections for resilience

### 4. Real-time analytics & insights
- Instant call logs and AI-driven insights
- Detailed user breakdowns for performance tracking

### 5. Centralized communication
- Unify voice, video, and messaging on one platform

### 6. Call quality
- High-quality digital calls with minimal dropouts
- Automatic error correction for clear audio

### 7. Security
- Dedicated, monitored connections with alerts for unusual activity

### 8. Flexibility
- Use local numbers in multiple regions
- Retain phone numbers when relocating

---

## How SIP trunking works

SIP trunking replaces ISDN and copper lines by sending digital call packets over data networks.

### SIP channels
- Each channel is like a digital phone line, allowing one inbound and one outbound call at a time
- Add new channels without extra hardware

### SIP trunks
- Group multiple channels (usually 20+)
- Bridge your phone system and your Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP)
- Connect PBX systems to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)

### SIP protocol
- Defines how to start and end internet-based communication
- Supports voice, video, and messaging

### SIP provider
- Offers SIP trunking services and integrates with your PBX or IP PBX

---

SIP trunking is a future-proof solution for cost-efficient, scalable, and feature-rich digital telephony. üí°
