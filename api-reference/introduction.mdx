## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.contactswing.ai
```

**Example endpoint:**
```
https://api.contactswing.ai/v2/_actions
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using a Workspace API key, provided in the `X-Workspace-Key` header. This is defined in the OpenAPI specification as an API key security scheme.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "WorkspaceAuth": []
  }
]
```

The header must be included in every request:

```http
X-Workspace-Key: <your-workspace-api-key>
```
