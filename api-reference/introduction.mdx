## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For this project, we are using the ContactSwing OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using a Workspace API key, provided in the `X-Workspace-Key` header. This is defined in the OpenAPI specification as an API key security scheme.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "WorkspaceAuth": []
  }
]
```

The header must be included in every request:

```http
X-Workspace-Key: <your-workspace-api-key>
```
